Initial ideas:

I really enjoyed creating my [midterm game](https://editor.p5js.org/noorajabir/sketches/7erJ7QDXq) modelled on a coffee machine, and I decided to build a physical version of the game for my final project. The idea was to create a coffee machine that would allow the player to physically select the grind size, amount of coffee and set the temperature, which would have coffee pour into a virtual cup that would be scored on the basis of the decisions the player made.

I started off by making a block diagram, pictured above. I planned out exactly what would happen in the game and in what sequence. I then created a rough schematic for the circuitry.
