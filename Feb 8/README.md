Here's my artwork:

*A little bit about the process:*

- This weekend, I spent quite a lot of time reading about coffee origins- with that, my artwork is an abstraction of the ripening process of coffee cherries, and its shifting color as it becomes ripe.
- Getting the right color was the most difficult part, but using the `while()` function made it much easier: I was able to change the stroke color without having to manually change it every time, which would've been exhausting.
- The most interesting part for me was seeing how one simple shape (ellipse) could be channeled by code to create visually diverse and vibrant images.
