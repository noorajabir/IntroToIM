For the midterm project, I decided to stick to my recurrent theme of 'coffee' and create a game based on the coffee brewing process. The idea was to have a game where the player tries to create a good cup of coffee by making a set of decisions, from grind size to brew temperature, and a good cup of coffee would mean that the player has won the game. I also thought it would be fun to call it 'caffeinate the college student', and give it the premise of the player being asked to make coffee to help a college student survive finals week. 

The game will have the following parts:
- start screen: instructions and title
- choose grind size
- measure amount
- choose temperature
- end screen

I think the most difficult part would be getting ground coffee of a particular grind size fall out of the grinder depending on the size chosen by the player. I decided to code that part first.
