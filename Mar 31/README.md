For this assignment, I created a switch that closes every time my earring touches a piece of aluminum on my neck. 

Initially, I tried creating a switch that used human touch itself as a conductor- I had taken a class in my Freshman year (called Circuit Breakers), in which we often used touch to close circuits, so that the person themself was part of the circuit. But I was not able to make this work with the circuit I built this week with Arduino- perhaps because the voltage was too low. So I decided to use a small piece of aluminum from a chocolate wrapper that I stuck on my neck. Since the earring was entirely metal, and connected with a wire to the breadboard, the circuit would be closed every time it touched the aluminum.
