For this assignment, I worked with Shaikha to complete the three tasks assigned in class:

- make something that uses only one sensor on arduino and makes the ellipse in p5 move on the horizontal axis, in the middle of the screen, and nothing on arduino is controlled by p5
- make something that controls the LED brightness from p5
- take the gravity wind example and make it so every time the ball bounces one led lights up and then turns off, and you can control the wind from one analog sensor
